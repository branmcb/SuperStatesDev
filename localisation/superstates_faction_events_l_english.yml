They state we must reduce the powers of the state church, and incentivise local populations to lead their congregations.

The bureacratic faction original disagreement has devolved into accusations launched at the plutocractic faction of committing major sins against the state. To avoid this disupte from escaping the legislative chambers into greater populous, the theocrats used considerable patience and skill in parliamentry procedure to intercede and help put an end to the matter."

The plutocratic faction is upset and demanding that a recently enacted policy promoted by the theocratic faction is outright hostile to the trade and business interests in the state.

 mexican_factions.1d:0 "The argument of whether power lying among a local government, or centralized in one governing body is as old as time itself. It is clear that at this time, the bureaucrats are strongly in favor of reducing local powers, and increasing the responsibility of the central government. The theocracy stands opposed to removing local power, fearing that one immoral ruler could destroy the principles of the nation, and by in part, who we are. Keeping local governments strong ensures leaders stay accountable."

But at times, it may become interested in securing nearby provinces, and destabilizing our enemies. The faction feels it is time for us to expand our influence in the region by force. The theocrats stand in direct opposition stating that taking land from another is not a justification to do battle, and that we will be judged for murder, and theft."

The Bureaucracy argues this could be a lot easier, if laws were enacted to grant the central government extra power should this nation enter crisis. The Plutocrats strongly oppose this measure, stating that the laws are too vague, and that the government would be able to tax, and control the free market whenever it chooses to, for however it wants."

 mexican_factions.4d:0 "A few dozen books were recently discovered in circulation which are extremely critical of several high governing officials. The material could be considered damaging, because it provides clear evidence of misconduct among these leaders. Bureaucrats are asking the state to destroy any, and all material damaging to the central government, and our way of governing, while severely punishing those who publish it. The Theocrats accuse the Bureaucrats of trying to cover up truth, and should be punished themselves. Insults have been exchanged both ways, and the court is in deadlock over the matter."

While this would have some great advantages in helping to stop division within our own camp, the Theocrats argue that this would take away who the soldier is, and transform them into mindless drones."

While some of these unions offer protections to workers, others simply appropriate income from employees, while not following through on their promises. Plutocrats have introduced a bill called 'Right to Work,' which, if passed, would give each citizen the right to opt out of joining a union, regardless of contracts.

Several locations have been determinted to be prime real estate to expand the nation's industry by the Plutocrats, and they are preapred to offer a great sum of money to appropriate the land. Theocrats believe that this is akin to stealing, and that any aquisition of land by the government should be dealt just like any regular private transaction.

They suggest that we set up a monetary fund to give them the necessary tools to feed, clothes, and perhaps earn for themselves. Distributing fishing rods, hunting knives, and almanacs on basic economics would stimulate the economy, according to one of the top businessman reporting in our court. However, Bureaucrats state this would directly threaten the country. They believe we ought to set aside a fund as well, but to use it to feed, and clothe people, instead of giving them the ability to do so themselves. This, they say, will help to maintain loyalty on the central government."
