 string_start_superstates_american_southwest:0 "By far one of the smaller regions, the §YAmerican Southwest§! should not be counted out. For what it lacks in states, this region makes up for in its valuable economic centers, raw gold, and expansion routes. If it can survive a military threat from both §YTexas§! and §YCalifornia§!, the §YSouthwest§! can make itself a formidable force by expanding into the §YIntermountain West§!, §YMexico§!, or even by curbing the influence of the §YTexan§! or §YCalifornian§! Republics."
 string_start_superstates_pacific_coast:0 "The end result of America's Manifest Destiny, the §YPacific Coast§! is both vast and affluent.\n\nWhile states in the north must be wary of §YColumbian§! expansion, the states of §YMexico§! remain reserved against §YCalifornian§! invasion. The relatively-weak states of the §YIntermountain West§! may prove to be viable expansion routes for Pacific states, or others may look towards the gold offered in the §YSouthwest§!. An empty §YPacific Ocean§! lies westward, providing a lucrative opportunity to establish a colonial empire that can stretch as far as §YOceania§! or even §YAustralia§!, well before the arrival of any European powers. The §YSan Francisco Bay§! is the economic center of this region, and control of it may prove invaluable in determining regional dominance.\n\nWhatever the goal may be, all Pacific states must be cautious of the long shadow of §YCalifornia§!, lest the Bear Republic catch them by surprise."
 string_start_superstates_intermountain_west:0 "The §YIntermountain West§! is as mountainous as it is unforgiving. While in a risky position as they are surrounded by potential enemies on all sides, any invading force will find it difficult to maintain an offensive in such rough terrain. This may prove to be an advantage as these states take the opportunity to grow their strength and ultimately stake a claim on the continent themselves."
 string_start_superstates_great_plains:0 "The §YGreat Plains§! of America are the bread basket of the continent, and this is reflected in the geography, terrain, and trading of the region. While this is by no means a wealthy region, there stands a great amount of potential for growth courtesy of the flat landscape, which is ideal for both developing infrastructure or conquest on horseback. Situated in the middle of the continent and surrounded on all sides, these states must ready themselves for attacks from any direction, at any time."
 string_start_superstates_great_lakes:0 "One of the earliest regions of both Canadian and American expansion are the §YGreat Lakes§!. This region is as large as it is culturally and nationally diverse, with a number of states and cultures calling it home. With no one state exerting dominance, there is no certainty in who will come to prominence here, if anyone: the threat of §YCanadian§! invasion is quite real, and all states here must remain vigilant against this threat.\n\nThe economic hubs of §YChicago§! and §YDetroit§! are lucrative targets for either further development or conquest, but other states may seek to make their cities even grander.\n\nUltimately, the state who is able to consolidate control here early on will find themselves with a plethora of options: establish Mare Nostrum over all the §YGreat Lakes§! by invading §YCanada§!, expand into the §YMidwest§!, or even cast an eye towards §YAppalachia§!: the opportunities are nigh-endless."
 string_start_superstates_american_south:0 "By far the most expansive and diverse region of the United States, the land of §YDixie§! stretches from eastern §YTexas§! all the way to §YVirginia§! and everywhere in-between.\n\nEnterprising states may find success in exploiting the lack of a strong regional presence early on in order to carve their own destiny in the region. Indeed, a handful of key conquests early on may prove vital to one's long-term success in the §YAmerican South§!.\n\nEconomical states will wish to look towards strong regional trade centers such as §YAtlanta§!, or the lucrative trade that flows down the §YMississippi River§! which dominates the region. Coastal states will eye an empty §YCaribbean§!, eager to embark on a quest to complete the §YGolden Circle§!. Although initially disparate, the thought of a unified Southern §YConfederacy§! remains prominent in the mind of many Governors. If a state were to achieve this feat, they would surely become a force to be reckoned with on a divided continent."
 string_start_superstates_mid_atlantic:0 "While not particularly expansive in size, the §YMid-Atlantic§! region of America is quite dense and very prosperous. Spanning from northern §YVirginia§! to the Hudson Valley of §YNew York§!, there is no shortage of metropolises in this region. Whether it be the shining jewel of America in §YNew York City§!, the industrious cities of northern §YNew Jersey§!, or the bustle of §YPhiladelphia§!, the §YMid-Atlantic§! has much to offer to anyone looking to enrich themselves. Much of the continent's trade ultimately flows into the ports of the §YNew York Harbor§!, and much of this region will be setting their eyes on this area."
 string_start_superstates_new_england:0 "The original, founding heart of America resides in the compact region of §YNew England§!. §YConnecticut§! and §YMassachusetts§! loom over this region, but larger still are the shadows of §YNew York§! and §YQuebec§! cast, who have their eyes on the treasures of the area. The disparate states of §YNew England§! must quickly unite in some capacity if they wish to be free from foreign intervention."
 string_start_superstates_oceanea:0 ""
 string_start_superstates_arctic_canada:0 "Despite its rugged and unforgiving nature, some still call the §YCanadian Arctic§! home. While it will almost certainly prove difficult, it is not impossible for these states to prosper with ample diplomacy, defensiveness, and opportunistic expansion.\n\nIn the east, §YNunavut§! remains relatively safe on its arctic islands, while in the west, the §YYukon§! and §YNorthern Territories§! must remain vigilant against any potential aggression from their numerous, more powerful neighbors.\n\nWhile an §YArctic Union§! may not prove to be the most dominant regional power, it will certainly make an invader think twice."
